feedback
I feel undervalued and rarely receive feedback from my manager.
I really enjoy working here. My team is supportive and helpful.
I'm considering leaving because there's no clear path for promotion.
The workload is manageable and the projects are interesting.
I'm dissatisfied with the current leadership and communication.
